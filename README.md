## Set Rotors

This Enigma Machine Simulator have 3 Rotors each need to be set initialized to a letter. Example Rotor I -> Q, Rotor II -> W, Rotor III -> E. Remember to decipher the message all rotors has to be the same when the message encripted.

## Setting the PlugBoard

The unique require to start to encript message in Enigma Machine Sim is set the three rotors, but if you want to add more "security" to your encrypeted message you can use the plugboard. What is the plugboard? The plugboard allow you interchange letter between them example A to Z and Z to A. The old Enigma makes this through wires, that is why before interchange letter ask you how many wire you want? 
Remeber to decipher the code you will need has the same rotors setting and Plugboard setting at when the message encripted.
